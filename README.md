# Elasticsearch-Learnings

Save the docker-compose.yml file to a directory and then run the following command from a terminal window to start up the Elasticsearch and Kibana containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Elasticsearch should be available via browser at http://localhost:9200/ and Kibana at http://localhost:5601/ if the setup was done correctly.

The different types of queries used to practice in Kibana under the Dev Tools tab are listed in the Practice-Queries.txt file while the most common queries template can be found in the Common-Queries.txt file
